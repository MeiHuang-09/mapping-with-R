[Code for Hands-on Workshop -- Fall 2018](https://github.com/libjohn/map-fall2018)

## Overview

These learning and quick-reference resource pages support the face-to-face workshop, _Mapping with R_, offered via the [Data & Visualization Services](https://library.duke.edu/data/) Department, Duke University Libraries. The exercises and workshop are designed to help you learn georeferencing, make a  [choropleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) with USA census data via the [tidycensus](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/) package, and briefly introducing the [simple features for R](http://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package. The introduction of these very useful R packages and some very basic concepts will give you enough information to make your own customized thematic maps.

During the Workshop we introduce

- Choropleths
- Polygons (shapes)
- Census Geography
- Briefly introduce ACS and Decennial census, plus Census API keys 
- Thematic mapping using _Simple Features for R_

## Workshop Resource Page

1. Georeferencing, Plotting XY latitude & longitude: with [interactive leaflet maps](01_georeference.html), with static [ggplot maps](01_ggmap_georef.html)

1. [Choropleths with tidycensus](02_choropleth.html)

1. [Thematic Mapping](030_thematic_sf.html) with `tmap`, `geom_sf`, `tigris`, and `viridis`.  Plus, saving map images and files.
