Please note:  These exercises assume you have downloaded the [mapping-with-R](https://github.com/libjohn/mapping-with-R) repository to your local installation of RStudio and are running this as a unique project within RStudio.  You should **also download the practice code** repository -- find that link on the main page of this guide.  

## Exercises

1. Georeference XY coordinates.  In your RStudio editor, open the `exercise-1_xy.Rmd file.  Plot XY (latitude/longitude) coordinates.

2. Choropleths with tidycensus.  Open `exercise-2_tidycensus.Rmd`.  Plot a new variable and shade that variable by county.  

3. Simple Features.  Open `exercise-3_thematic-map_with_federal_data.Rmd`.  Make a choropleth of the data using either ggplot2, tmap, or leaflet.  Use the knowledge you gained in the **Thematic Mapping** module on this site.
