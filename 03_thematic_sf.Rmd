## Workshop Sections

1. [Basic thematic mapping](031_thematic_mapping.html): creating choropleth's with `tmap`

1. [Interactive thematic mapping](033_thematic_leaflet_example.html) with leaflet

1. [Sharing ouput files](036_thematic_mapping-outputs-fullwebpage.html): saving maps.

## Simple Features

The initial modules of *Mapping in R* introduce plotting latitude and longitude with an interactive map (`leaflet`), and generating a thematic map using `tidycensus.`  The focus of this module is to introduce other customized thematic map packages: `tmap`, `sf`, `ggplot2` (using ggplot::geom_sf).  

**The backbone of this type of mapping data manipulation is the `sf` package** -- sf for simple features -- which is a modern tidyverse compatible package for encoding spatial vector data. The advantage of manipulating data as simple features (i.e. sf) over `sp` is that the `sp` package ("spatial polygons") uses the old school @data slots method.  If you're used to this, `sp` uses a highly functional data structure.  R modernists and tidyverse fans may be inclined toward the `sf` approach.  Among the advantages, you can can see your data in a more familiar and easy-to-view format, a data frame -- rather than a slot.

> `sf` simple features package affords the R coder an easy and familiar method of **storing data** vectors and **shapefile** polygons in a **tidy data frame**.

First let's introduce the `tmap` package which you'll see is an easy-to-use package used to build spatial distributions on geographic maps.  These maps are png files: easy to produce and share.  In this section we'll use the `tigris` package to get a Census Shapefile and store the object as an `sf` object which we will later join into our data frame.

> You can also store your data in a **slot** using the `sp` package.

Then we'll make another interactive choropleth with leaflet.  This second section is largely a repeat of the earlier choropleth module, but it is also the set up for the third section about saving maps as files.  The map's interactivity is sparse but functional by moving beyond traditional 2D map-on-a-page images. Indeed, this interactive map allows the end-user to zoom in and out. Just know that this interactive feature is possible **because** we draw the map as a leaflet map.  Putting this lesson together with the plotting module, you now have the skills to add additional interactive layers (e.g. pop-up windows).  Here we'll focus on developing another choropleth as a setup for section three.

Section three introduces techniques for saving these maps as files that can then be shared and distributed as interactive maps, either on the web, as an html file, or as shapefile.

> `sf` v `sp`?  Leave the debate to others.  I like the tidyverse and `sf` enables tremendous functionality and a familiar data science landscape.  

## Converting between `sf` and `sp`

It's easy! See [Reading, Writing and Converting Simple Features](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf2.html)
