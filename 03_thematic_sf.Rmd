## Simple Features

The first sections introduced you to plotting latitude and longitude on an interactive map (`leaflet`), and generating a thematic map using `tidycensus`.  A good next step is to learn how to make other customized thematic maps with some more useful packages: `tmap`, `ggplot2` (ggplot::geom_sf), `sf`).  **The backbone of this type of mapping data manipulation is the `sf` package** -- sf for simple features -- which is a modern, tidyverse compatible, package for encoding spatial vector data.  

## Sections

1. 030 -- basic thematic mapping

1. 036 -- thematic mapping with interactive maps (using leaflet)

1. 039 -- Sharing ouputs, saving maps (and files)

1. sf v sp

## Hands-on

Head over to the [exercises section] and try to make your own thematic map.
