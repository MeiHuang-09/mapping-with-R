We employ the [Tidyverse](//www.tidyverse.org/) approach throughout the *Mapping with R* workshop and **we assume you are already familiar with *Tidyverse* R**.  If not, please review our [Introduction to R](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/intro2r/) in advance of the workshop.  

We will teach in our training lab (023 Bostock) unless otherwise stated in the registration information.  The **workstations in the Lab are preconfigured** with all the necessary [software](#software) and [libraries.](#packages)  Therefore, we *will not take time to install software or configure personal laptops.*  All libraries, packages, code, and data are shareable and documented through this website. A link to the repository is in the header.

## Software

**If you are not attending** the workshop **in person**, you will need to install the following software to complete the hands-on portions of the workshop.  

- **R**: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/"" target="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>
    
- **RStudio**: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target="_blank">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a>.  Technically, you can do all the work without RStudio.  However, the code was composed, run, and tested in RStudio. (I can verify this configuration.  Others may work. YMMV.)

- **Pacakages**:  The packages used for this workshop are listed in the session info below, or in the code at the top of each module or section.



## Workshop Philosophy

*Mapping with R* is a two hour workshop, part of the R learning series entitled [*R We Having Fun Yetâ€½*](//rfun.library.duke.edu/) hosted by the [Data & Visualization Services Department](//library.duke.edu/data/) at the Duke University Libraries.  We will approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the tidyverse. We believe this open tool-set provides a context that enables and reinforces reproducible workflows, analysis, and reporting.

As part of the workshop we create opportunities for reinforced active learning by creating [hands-on exercises](exercises.html).  You will have time to complete these exercises during the workshop.
