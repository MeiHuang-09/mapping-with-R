## Prerequisites

We employ the [Tidyverse](//www.tidyverse.org/) approach throughout the *Mapping with R* workshop and **we assume you are already familiar with R**.  If not, please review our [Introduction to R](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/intro2r/) in advance of the workshop.  

We will teach in our training lab (023 Bostock) unless otherwise stated in the registration information.  The **worksations in the Lab are preconfigured** with all the necessary software and libraries.  Therefore, we *will not take time to install software or configure personal laptops.*  All libraries, packages, code, and data are shareable and documented through this website.  You can clone the repository 

## Software Installation

### Software

**If you are not attending** the workshop **in person**, to complete the hands-on portion of the workshop you'll need software preinstalled.  

- **R**: <a href="http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/"" target="_blank">http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/</a>

    - If you have not installed R before choose *install R for the first time*
    - If you already have R installed on your workstation I recommend running the latest version, but any reasonably current version should be fine.
    
- **RStudio**: <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download" target="_blank">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a> 

- **Pacakages**:  The packages used for this workshop are listed in the session info below, or in the code at the top of each module or section.



## Workshop Philosophy

*Mapping with R* is a two hour workshop, part of the R learning series entitled [*R We Having Fun Yetâ€½*](//rfun.library.duke.edu/) hosted by the [Data & Visualization Services Department](//library.duke.edu/data/) at the Duke University Libraries.  We will approach R using the free RStudio IDE, an intent to make reproducible literate code, and a bias towards the tidyverse. We believe this open tool-set provides a context that enables and reinforces reproducible workflows, analysis, and reporting.

You can find links to previous recordings of this workshop, along with shareable data sets, at the [mapping section](//rfun.library.duke.edu/categories/mapping/) of the Rfun site.  Similarly you will find links to our broader array of workshop resources at the the *Guides* or *Workshops* sections of our [DVS website](//library.duke.edu/data/)
