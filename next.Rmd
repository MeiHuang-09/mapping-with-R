## Preamble

In this workshop we have barely scratched the surface of how R can enable GIS analysis.  Many GIS analysts matriculated through the world of ESRI products such as ArcGIS and ArcGIS Online, or the opensource QGIS option.  There are also interesting cloud options such as Carto.com.  We do not presume that all your GIS analytics can be accomplished via R.  Nor do we presume that they cannot.  If you are already an R user, you will find this introduction to mapping is the first step in a satisfying journey of reproducible GIS analytics.  However, there are a few points we'd like to make...

## Reproducibility

<img src="facet_map.png" height = "100" width = "150" style="float: right">As a blanket statement reproducibility is highly recommended.  As a practical recommendation the more you produce your reports via the Tidy Data + Literate Code + R Markdown methods (i.e. tidyverse), the more likely you can transparently and openly reproduce your processes.  As a side benefit you can reproduce variations on a thematic maps with minimal code.

One specific example of producing multiple maps would be to leverage the `ggplot2` faceting features (`facet_grid` or `facet_wrap`).  These functions enable production of multiple ggplot maps that differ by categorical or continuous variables.

The example on the right was produced with `facet_wrap`.  You can find some documentation of this code in the [Simple Features](030_thematic_sf.html) module.


## Design Best Practices

Drew Keener has something to say here

## Other Local Resources

We highly recommend the [Student Association for Geospatial Analysis](https://sites.duke.edu/saga/).   Also, look for the [R-Ladies RTP](https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/) group.  They do great work.

## Interactivity 

Tools such as [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) or [HTML Widgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) can be used in combination with dashboards. (e.g. In particular, [Flexdashboard for R](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)) can be leveraged to showcase interactivity of Shiny and HTML Widgets.  

Of course, you may need hosting capabilities andDuke has some ready-made Shiny hosting and static-webpage hosting. (Remember that static webpages can still be interactive, especially when using HTML Widgets.)  Alternatively, for hosting we've used a tool like netlify.com and found it very capable of hosting our static web presence.

## Shapefiles

Shapefiles are a staple of portable GIS data.  In this course we give a cursory mention of the shapefile format.  However, it's important to highlight that the `sf` package can read and write shapefiles (or GeoJSON files, or a whole host of other formats).  Our [*GIS Data: Starting Points* guide](https://guides.library.duke.edu/gisdata) provides a very handy collection of data sources, much of which will be in the shapefiles format.  Consider consulting with our GIS experts in the DVS Department for information about sources of shapefiles.

## Raster 

There are many more advanced things to learn about GIS analysis in R.  One of the most common questions is how to handle Raster files.  It's definitely possible and we hope to offer a workshop about this.  In the meantime look into:

- The [raster package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/)
- This [post](http://r-spatial.org/r/2016/09/26/future.html) by Edzer Pebesma and Robert Hijmans
- This [proposal](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars/blob/master/PROPOSAL.md)
